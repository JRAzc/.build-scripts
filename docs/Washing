1) Empty a cup or two of epsom salts on to cookie sheet or baking dish or whatnot and stick in the oven on 350F for about 3 hours.
2) Remove and break up the larger chunks.
3) Throw the salts in the acetone container and shake it up real good.
4) Let it settle. There you go. Dry Acetone.

How to Recrystalize:
1) Stick your meth in a beaker or pyrex measuring cup that most kitchens have.

2) Start adding dropwise, very slowly, very hot, dry ethanol. It's crucial to only use a minumum amount of ethanol. One or two drops too many will fuck up the whole process.
2a) As soon as you see the last bit of meth dissolve, you are done adding the EtOH.

3) Let it cool...slowly. First let it cool down to room temperature. Now put the beaker in a pan filled with cold water to bring the temp down a little more. Next stick it in the fridge. Now put the beaker in the freezer. The whole process should take hours for the best results. Take your time.
3a) When moving it from one stage to the next do so carefully. If you shake it up at all this can also disrupt the process.

4) Now after the water has cooled down enough the shardlike crystals will being to form. The crystal formation actually acts like legos. Like pieces of a puzzle, the meth crystals will fit together perfectly thus pushing out any impurities from the crytal formations.

5) Now pur off the EtOH/impurities and you can now scrape out your shards.
During step three it's imprtant to really take your time. Dont rush it.
The good thing about this is you really cant make any mistakes that'll ruin your product. If you messed up somewhere and dont end up with shards you can always evap off the ethanol and start over. Your product is still in there.

Acetone will remove MOST impurities, but some will get through. Unfortunately, glucose (or sugar) is one of the ones that it won’t remove. So if you know that it has glucose in it, don’t bother… if you really want to clean it you must A/B. (freebase it then convert it back to its salt form)

If you want to wash your meth really well, then ideally, you’ll need to recrystalise it as well. The slower the crystals form, the larger they will be. As a bonus, the impurities usually grow on the outside of the meth crystal. The reason this is good is if you have a large crystal with the crap on the outside, when the acetone is added it will dissolve the impurities and wont have as great a chance to dissolve your meth. (Lots of small crystals means larger surface area, which means larger chance of the acetone dissolving the meth… especially if the acetone isn’t really dry.

Drying Acetone
You’ll Need:
Acetone
Epsom salts
Filter paper (coffee filters work fine)
Oven

Most acetone that you’ll buy will be dry enough to use for washing. Though the older it is the greater the chance it has absorbed moisture from the air.

Put some of the Epsom salts on a tray in the oven for an hour or so on at least 130 degrees Centigrade. (This is to dry any moisture out of them)

Pour the Epsom salts into the acetone and mix them around.

Filter the acetone through the filter paper.

Ideally, use the acetone soon, to avoid it re-absorbing more moisture.

Acetone Wash
You’ll Need:
Acetone (really cold, to avoid losses)
Bowl (ideally glass, shallow & with straight sides. Not too wide either, 4inch[10cm] is a good size)
Knife (a pointed steak knife works well)[*]Put the Meth in bowl.[*]Add the cold acetone. 

You want enough that it can dissolve all the impurities, but the acetone potentially contains water, which means lost meth. (The water dissolves the meth) 30-50mL is usually enough for ½-1gram. 

You’ll obviously need more if your bowl has a larger surface area.[*]Swish the bowl around and then use the knife to break up any larger bits of impurities.[*]The less time the meth sits in the acetone, the less chance it will have of getting dissolved. So try to do it quickly, but don’t hurry and fuck it up. 

A minute or so will be fine.[*]Tip the bowl onto an angle and swish it around so that all of the meth is together in a corner.[*]Let it settle out for a short while, then SLOWLY tip the bowl around so that the meth stays in the corner and the acetone drains off and is now on the other side of the bowl.[*]

The acetone can be poured off or you can leave the bowl propped up on an angle and let it evaporate. A small amount of meth will be in the acetone. You can pour it off into another bowl and then do more acetone washes on it if you want. [But also remember; use the minimum number of bowls, etc as each one will contribute to the mechanical loss. 

If you pour it off into a second bowl and do another wash, do the next pour off into the first bowl. (After the clean meth has been removed)][*]

Let the meth dry out completely. Just let it sit there, or put it in the sun for a while.[*]It should now be relatively clean. More acetone washes can be performed if it still looks to be dirty. 

Ideally, you should recrystalise the meth in between acetone washes (and even before the first wash)[/list=a]

Clean meth is a white-ish/cloudy crystal that will give off white vapour when heated, and will leave only the smallest residue after it is all vaporized.

[Note: heat it -> it melts at around 120 degrees Celsius... don’t fry it or let the flame come in contact with it.]

Recrystalisation
You’ll Need:
Bowl (same as the one above)
Ethanol (Methylated Spirits works fine)
Knife (or a metal skewer or similar to help break up those stubborn bits)

[Note: the larger the surface area of the bowl, the more mechanical loss you will have. Any part of the bowl that the Methylated Spirits comes in contact with will be left with a tiny amount of meth once it evaporates. Therefore if you tried to do ½ gram on something the size of a baking tray, you will get a shit yield.][*]Put the meth in the bowl.[*]

Heat a small amount of Methylated Spirits (a glass in the microwave works, just don’t put it on for too long)[*]Meth is quite soluble in Methylated Spirits, so you want to use as little as possible. Using more isn’t bad; it just takes longer to evaporate. 20-30mL for ½ gram should do.[*]

Swish it around and then use the knife to help break up any bits that won’t dissolve.[*]Some of the impurities will dissolve, some wont. If you’re unsure, add a tiny bit more Methylated Spirits and see if any more dissolves. If not then it’s probably an impurity.[*]

If there are undissolved impurities, tip the bowl onto an angle and swish it around so that all the impurities are together in a corner.[*]

Let it settle out for a while, then SLOWLY tip the bowl around so that the crap stays where it is and the Methylated Spirits drains off it and is now on the other side of the bowl.[*]Scrape the crap out of the bowl.[*]

Next, let it evaporate… the slower the better, as this will form larger crystals. Just leave it on the bench, or out in the sun. Just be sure to let it stay still, as moving it about will damage the growing process and they wont end up as big.[*]

Make sure it is 100% dry, because if you do an acetone wash while it is wet, then the meth that is still dissolved in the Methylated Spirits will dissolve in the acetone.
